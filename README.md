CMU 18748 - Wireless Sensor Networks

This repository contains the project Smart Restaurants that I and my partner Shubhankar developed for the course 18748.

1. We have implemented lighting system capable of turning itself on/off by monitoring the output of Passive Infrared sensor which detects the presence of customer near the table. The customer can control the light color by choosing convenient light settings.

2. There is also a temperature control system that utilizes DHT22 sensor to current temperature value around the table and the customer can feed in a value of his interest to switch on the fan/heater. 

3. Next, we have built an online ordering app using Android Studio to remove the conventional way of taking orders through pen and paper. To record customerâ€™s order requests, we have used Firebase (real-time database). 

4. To automate payments, we used Smart Card payments. A Smart Card is an initiative of our restaurant to make our customers go cashless. It has a RFID tag and can be swiped on the centralized card reader. Payments are wirelessly recorded on the database. 

All these user-friendly systems are to make sure our customers put in least efforts to make interaction with the waiters. This improves efficiency and accuracy for restaurants by saving time and reduces human errors.

Please see the Project Report for BOM cost and design details.
